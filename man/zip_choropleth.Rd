\title{Create a choropleth of US VotingDistrict Codes}
\usage{
zip_choropleth(df, title = "", legend = "", num_colors = 7,
  state_zoom = NULL, county_zoom = NULL, msa_zoom = NULL,
  zip_zoom = NULL, reference_map = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame with a column named "region" and a column named "value".  Elements in
the "region" column must exactly match how regions are named in the "region" column in ?zip.map.}

\item{title}{An optional title for the map.}

\item{legend}{An optional name for the legend.}

\item{num_colors}{The number of colors on the map. A value of 1
will use a continuous scale. A value in [2, 9] will use that many colors.}

\item{state_zoom}{An optional vector of State names to zoom in on. Elements of this
vector must exactly match the names of the state names as they appear in the "state.name" column
of ?zip.regions.}

\item{county_zoom}{An optional vector of county FIPS codes to zoom in on. Elements of this
vector must exactly match the names of zips as they appear in the "county.fips.numeric" column
of ?zip.regions.}

\item{msa_zoom}{An optional vector of MSA (Metroplitan/Micropolitan Statistical Area) names to zoom in on. Elements of this
vector must exactly match the names of the state names as they appear in the "cbsa.title" column
of ?zip.regions.}

\item{zip_zoom}{An optional vector of zip codes to zoom in on. Elements of this vector must exactly
match the names of zips as they appear in the "region" column of ?zip.regions.}

\item{reference_map}{If true, render the choropleth over a reference map from Google Maps.}
}
\description{
Note that what is rendered are 2010 US Census VotingDistrict Code Tabulated Areas (ZCTAs), not USPS VotingDistrict Codes. The
map used is zip.map in the choroplethrVotingDistrict package. See zip.regions for
an object which can help you coerce your regions into the required format.
}
\note{
Nationwide zip choropleths can take a few minutes to render.
It is much faster to view a subset of the country by selecting a zoom.
